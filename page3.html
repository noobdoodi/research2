    <font size="+2">As to Britannica, Child labor refers to anyone under the legally specified working age. The fair labor standards of 1938 set 14 as the legal working age. The first law, instated in 1802, aimed to control apprenticeship, this was ineffective considering the fact this law didn't have any reinforcement. Then in the 1830s, the Factory Act provided factory inspections. In the 1890s, International powers met in Berlin for the first "Internation Labour Conference" the goal of this conference was to regulate child labor, that goal was not reached at the time.</font
